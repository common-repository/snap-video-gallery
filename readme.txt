Easy-to-use video gallery that enables you to insert a gallery of videos into a page or post.

== Description ==

Snap Video Gallery will help you quickly create a responsive gallery of videos for any WordPress post or page.

It takes just a couple of minutes to create your gallery:

* Create a gallery in Snap by entering videos from either YouTube or Vimeo.
* Insert the gallery into a post or page using a shortcode or the Snap Video Gallery block.
* Select a two column or three column layout.

That's it!

Videos will pop-up in a modal window to play.

Snap is mobile friendly and plays well with smart phones and tablets.
